# PredictionAssignment

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, the goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.

The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. We may use any of the other variables to predict with.   

The report describes  

- how we built our model, 
- how we used cross validation, 
- what we think the expected out of sample error is, and 
- why we made the choices we did.
